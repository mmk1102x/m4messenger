# 🛰️ M4messenger

**M4messenger** is a decentralized, serverless peer-to-peer (P2P) messaging application built for maximum privacy and cross-device compatibility. By utilizing **Mesh Network** technology, your data lives in the collective browsers of the users—never on a central server.

---

## ✨ Features

- **🌐 Serverless Mesh:** Powered by Gun.js. No central database. Data is shared directly between peers.
- **🆔 Identity v4:** Professional Telegram-style handles. Every user has a **Display Name** and a unique **@username** (customizable, no spaces allowed).
- **🎨 Universal Themes:** 11 chromatic styles synced across the main chat, login, and registration pages.
- **💾 Local Persistence:** Chat history is saved to your browser's local cache (LocalStorage/IndexedDB) so it survives page reloads even when offline.
- **📱 Responsive UI:** Completely fluid design. Buttons and panels adapt to any screen size without fixed constraints.
- **📟 Console CLI:** Full control via the browser console (`F12`). Run `cmd('command')` on any page.
